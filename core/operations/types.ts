/**
 * Vocabulary for recoverable multi-step operations.
 *
 * A multi-step operation is any flow that touches the outside world more than
 * once: issuing a ticket, submitting a payment, redeeming a receipt. Each step
 * writes a checkpoint *before* it is attempted, so an interruption — a closed
 * tab, a reload, a relayer timeout — leaves enough behind to answer the only
 * question that matters: what exactly already happened?
 *
 * Everything here is plain data. A record read back from storage can be
 * replayed by a test or reasoned about by a maintainer without running code.
