/**
 * Deterministic recovery for interrupted multi-step operations.
 *
 * The contract is one entry point — `runOperation` — that both starts and
 * resumes a flow. Given the same record and the same definitions it makes the
 * same decision, because every decision is derived from the checkpoint on disk
 * rather than from an in-memory step index:
 *
 * - a step whose checkpoint says `succeeded` is never run again;
 * - a step that reported its effect landed (`sideEffectCommitted`) is never run
 *   again either — the flow stops and asks a human to confirm the outcome;
 * - a step that stopped without reporting is retried *with the same idempotency
 *   key*, so the outside world sees one request, not two.
 *
 * Nothing here retries on a timer or in the background. Recovery is driven by a
 * caller that deliberately resumes an operation, which keeps the flow testable
 * and keeps a stuck operation visible instead of silently looping.
